# PoC - LSP violations detector

A PHP proof-of-concept that detects **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** violations, focusing on exception contracts between classes and their contracts (interfaces and parent classes).

## What it checks

A subclass or implementation must not weaken the contract of its parent or interface. This POC verifies that **exception contracts** are respected:

- A method must not **declare** (in docblocks) or **throw** (in code) exception types that are not allowed by the contract (interface or parent class).
- If the contract says nothing about exceptions, the implementation must not throw (or declare) any.
- If the contract documents `@throws SomeException`, the implementation may throw that type.

Violations are reported in two ways:

1. **Docblock violations** — `@throws` in the implementation that are not in the contract.
2. **Code violations** — actual `throw` statements (detected via AST) for exception types not allowed by the contract.

## Features

- **Docblock analysis** — parses `@throws` from PHPDoc (supports piped types, FQCN, descriptions).
- **AST analysis** — uses [nikic/php-parser](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser) to detect real `throw` statements:
  - Direct throws: `throw new RuntimeException()`
  - Conditional throws: `if (...) throw new E()`
  - Re-throws in catch: `catch (E $e) { throw $e; }`
  - **Transitive throws** — follows `$this->method()` calls within the same class (e.g. public method calling a private method that throws).
- **Contract comparison** — checks against all implemented interfaces and the parent class.
- **Cached parsing** — each file is parsed once; results are reused for multiple methods.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- Composer

## Installation

```bash
composer require tivins/poc-liskov-check
```

## Usage

### Scan a directory

Pass a directory path as argument. The checker will recursively find all PHP classes and check them:

```bash
php lsp-checker.php src/
```

The classes (and their contracts — interfaces, parent classes) must be loadable. If a `vendor/autoload.php` is found in or near the target directory, it is included automatically.

Without a directory, the script prints usage and exits:

```bash
php lsp-checker.php
# Usage: lsp-checker.php <directory> [--json] [--quiet]
#   ...
```

### Run unit tests

The example classes in `liskov-principles-violation-example.php` are used by PHPUnit tests:

```bash
composer install
composer test # or vendor/bin/phpunit
```

### Output streams (stdout / stderr)

- **stdout** — Program result only: either human-readable [PASS]/[FAIL] lines (default) or a single JSON report when `--json` is used. Safe to redirect or pipe (e.g. `> out.json`).
- **stderr** — Progress and summary messages (“Checking…”, “Classes checked: …”, etc.). Suppressed with `--quiet`.

So you can capture only the result in a file and keep logs separate.

### Options

| Option    | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `<path>`  | **Required.** Directory to scan recursively for PHP classes. |
| `--quiet` | Suppress progress and summary on stderr. Only the result (stdout) is produced — useful for CI or when piping. |
| `--json`  | Machine-readable output: write only the JSON report to stdout; no [PASS]/[FAIL] lines. |

### Pipes and redirections

| Goal | Command |
|------|--------|
| Save JSON report to a file | `php lsp-checker.php src/ --json > report.json` |
| Save human result, hide progress | `php lsp-checker.php src/ --quiet > result.txt` |
| Save progress/summary to a log | `php lsp-checker.php src/ 2> progress.log` (result stays on terminal) |
| JSON only, no progress (e.g. CI) | `php lsp-checker.php src/ --json --quiet 2>/dev/null` |
| Result to file, progress to another file | `php lsp-checker.php src/ --json > report.json 2> progress.log` |

To pipe the JSON into another tool (e.g. [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)), use `--json --quiet` so only JSON goes to stdout:

```bash
php lsp-checker.php src/ --json --quiet | jq 'length'
```

Example output:

```
Checking Liskov Substitution Principle...

[FAIL] MyClass1
       -> MyClass1::doSomething() — contract MyInterface1 — @throws RuntimeException declared in docblock but not allowed by the contract
       -> MyClass1::doSomething() — contract MyInterface1 — throws RuntimeException in code (detected via AST) but not allowed by the contract
[PASS] MyClass2
[FAIL] MyClass3
       ...
[FAIL] MyClass4
       -> MyClass4::process() — contract MyInterface4 — throws RuntimeException in code (detected via AST) but not allowed by the contract
[FAIL] MyClass5
       -> MyClass5::process() — contract MyInterface5 — throws RuntimeException in code (detected via AST) but not allowed by the contract

Classes checked: 5
Passed: 1 / 5
Total violations: 8
```

- **Exit code**: `0` if all classes pass, `1` if any violation is found (suitable for CI).
- **JSON report**: Use `--json` to write the full list of violations to stdout in JSON format.

```

- **ThrowsDetector**  
  - `getDeclaredThrows(ReflectionMethod)` — returns exception types from `@throws` in the docblock.  
  - `getActualThrows(ReflectionMethod)` — returns exception types from the method body (and transitively from `$this->method()` in the same class) via AST.

- **LiskovSubstitutionPrincipleChecker**  
  - `check(string $className)` — returns `LspViolation[]`.  
  - For each method that overrides/implements a contract method, compares both declared and actual throws to the contract and reports any that are not allowed.

- **ClassFinder**  
  - `findClassesInDirectory(string $directory)` — recursively scans a directory for `.php` files, extracts fully qualified class names via AST, loads the files, and returns the class list.

## Example cases (included)

| Class    | Contract      | Result | Reason |
|----------|---------------|--------|--------|
| MyClass1 | No throws     | FAIL   | Throws and declares `RuntimeException` |
| MyClass2 | `@throws RuntimeException` | PASS | Contract allows the throw |
| MyClass3 | No throws     | FAIL   | Declares and throws via private helper |
| MyClass4 | No throws     | FAIL   | Throws in code, no docblock (AST-only detection) |
| MyClass5 | No throws     | FAIL   | Throws via `$this->doSomething()` (transitive AST) |

## Limitations

- **Intra-class only** — only `$this->method()` calls within the same class are followed; calls to other classes or traits are not analyzed.
- **No flow analysis** — e.g. `$e = new E(); throw $e;` is not resolved (we only handle `throw new X` and re-throws of catch variables).
- **Reflection-based** — only works on loadable PHP code (files that can be parsed and reflected). When scanning a directory, a `vendor/autoload.php` is loaded automatically if found nearby.
- **Exception contracts only** — no checks yet for parameter types (contravariance) or return types (covariance).
